# Flying

A minecraft spigot plugin that allows you infinitely fly without an elytra for fun.

## Features

This plugin allows players to use the /fly command to enter into flying mode. This will
mimic having an elytra, but will not reset upon touching the ground, allowing players
to glide indefinately.
