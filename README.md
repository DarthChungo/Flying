# Flying

A simple minecraft plugin that allows you **infinitely fly** without an **elytra**.

## Features

This plugin allows players to use the **/fly** command that takes no arguments and sets the player
in a elytra flying like state that does not revert when the player **hits the ground**. To 
disable it, simply type the command again.
